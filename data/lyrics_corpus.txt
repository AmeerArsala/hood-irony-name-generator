Move! Cant stop thinking about if and when I die For now I see that if and when are truly different cries For if is purely panic and when is solemn sorrow And one invades today while the other spies tomorrow Were surrounded and were hounded Theres no above, or under, or around it For above is blind belief and under is sword to sleeve And around is scientific miracle, lets pick above and see For if and when we go above, the question still remains Are we still in love and is it possible we feel the same? And thats when goin under starts to take my wonder But until that time, Ill try to sing this If I keep moving, they wont know Ill morph to someone else What they throw at mes too slow Ill morph to someone else Im just a ghost Ill morph to someone else A defense mechanism mode Hell always try to stop me, that Nicolas Bourbaki Hes got no friends close but those who know him most know He goes by Nico, he told me Im a copy When Id hear him mock me, thats almost stopped me Well, were surrounded and were hounded Theres no above or a secret door What are we here for If not to run straight through all our tormentors? But until that time, Ill try to sing this If I keep moving, they wont know Ill morph to someone else What they throw at mes too slow Ill morph to someone else Im just a ghost Ill morph to someone else A defense mechanism mode Ill morph to someone else Lights, they blink to me, transmitting things to me Ones and zeroes, ergo this symphony Anybody listening? Ones and zeroes Count to infinity, ones and zeroes Im surrounded and Im hounded Theres no above, or under, or around it For above is blind belief and under is sword to sleeve And around is scientific miracle, lets pick above and see For if and when we go above, the question still remains Are we still in love and is it possible we feel the same? And thats when goin under starts to take my wonder But until that time Ill morph to someone else Im just a ghost If I keep moving, they wont know Ill morph to someone else What they throw at mes too slow Ill morph to someone else Im just a ghost Ill morph to someone else A defense mechanism mode If I keep moving, they wont know Ill morph to someone else A defense mechanism mode Ill morph to someone else Not done, not done Not done, Josh Dun Ill morph to someone else
Call Call Call Whats my problem? Well, I want you to follow me down to the bottom Underneath the insane asylum Keep your wits about you while you got em Cause your wits are first to go while youre problem-solvin And my problem? We glorify those even more when they... My opinion, our culture can treat a loss like its a win And right before we turn on them We give em the highest of praise And hang their banner from the ceiling Communicating, further engraving An earlier grave is an optional way, no Neon gravestones try to call Neon gravestones try to call for my bones Call Call, call, call Call Call Whats my problem? Dont get it twisted Its with the people we praise who may have assisted I could use the streams and extra conversations I could give up, and boost up my reputation I could go out with a bang They would know my name They would host and post a celebration My opinion will not be lenient My opinion, its real convenient Our words are loud, but now Im talking action We dont get enough love? Well, they get a fraction They say, How could he go if hes got everything? Ill mourn for a kid, but wont cry for a king Neon gravestones try to call Neon gravestones try to call for my bones Call Call, call, call Promise me this If I lose to myself You wont mourn a day And youll move onto someone else Promise me this If I lose to myself You wont mourn a day And youll move onto someone else Neon gravestones try to call Neon gravestones try to call for my bones Neon gravestones try to call Neon gravestones try to call for my bones Cause they wont get them No, they wont get them They wont get them But they wont get them Dont get me wrong, the rise in awareness Is beating a stigma that no longer scares us But for sake of discussion, in spirit of fairness Could we give this some room for a new point of view? And could it be true that some could be tempted To use this mistake as a form of aggression? A form of succession? A form of a weapon? Thinking Ill teach them Well, Im refusing the lesson It wont resonate in our minds Im not disrespecting what was left behind Just pleading that it does not get glorified Maybe we swap out what it is that we hold so high Find your grandparents or someone of age Pay some respects for the path that they paved To life, they were dedicated Now, that should be celebrated
Im taking over my body, back in control, no more shotty I bet a lot of me was lost, Ts uncrossed and Is undotted I fought it a lot and it seems a lot like flesh is all I got Not any more, flesh out the door, SWAT!

You think twice about your life, it probably happens at night, right? Fight it, take the pain, ignite it Tie a noose around your mind, loose enough to breathe fine And tie it to a tree tell it, You belong to me This aint a noose, this is a leash And I have news for you, you must obey me!
